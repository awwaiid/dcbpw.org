DESCRIPTION:Unicode is much more than just characters. The Unicode Consorti
 um defines open standards for collating\, parsing\, and formatting data in
  much of the world’s languages. The Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) i
 s the largest standard repository of locale data along with specifications
  for its use and is a powerful resource for software localization. Unicode
  CLDR is quickly becoming the de facto locale standard with widespread use
  among companies including Google\, Apple\, and IBM\; projects ranging fro
 m Linux distributions to Wikipedia\; and increasing support in many progra
 mming languages.\n\nThis talk will provide an introduction to software loc
 alization with the CLDR\, highlight several CLDR-based CPAN projects\, dem
 onstrate how Shutterstock uses and contributes to them\, and discuss the r
 emaining work for the Perl community to provide first-class CLDR support.

DESCRIPTION:Schedule:\n\nAdvances in Multilingual Stemming on CPAN\nReferen
 ce on References\nWeb Identity Techniques & Perl\nCivic Hacking\, Youth Ed
 ucation\, and popularizing Perl\nTwitterers Anonymous\n\n\n\nThese Lig­htn
 ­ing Talks may be seri­ous\, funny\, or both. They may be given by ex­peri
 en­ced speak­ers al­ready giv­ing full length talks or by first time speak
 ­ers just start­ing out (this is a great way to get star­ted if you have s
 ome­th­ing to say). If you are a first time speak­er you will win a tie wi
 th an ex­peri­ence speak­er when the schedule is made if it comes to it. T
 oday's first time speak­er could give tomor­row's keynote.\n\nWe will have
  about 5 Lig­htn­ing Talks of 5 minutes. Sub­mit your talk through the sub
 ­mit talk link on this web­site. The first de­ad­line is with the full len
 gth talks. The second de­ad­line is one week be­fore the con­fer­ence star
 ts and many pro­pos­als will be ac­cepted. At least one speak­ing spot wil
 l be held open until the morning of the talks to give you a chan­ce to see
  some­th­ing at the con­fer­ence and put togeth­er a Lig­htn­ing Talk re­s
 pon­se. Howev­er if you wait for the later de­ad­lines note that there are
  fewer spots avail­able and you are less li­ke­ly to be ac­cepted so pleas
 e try to sub­mit more than a week be­fore the con­fer­ence.\n\nIn ad­di­ti
 on to the five minute Lig­htn­ing Talks where you get to use your com­put­
 er\, slides\, and any other tool\, we will also have some Lig­htn­ing Ad­v
 ertise­ments. These are only 30 seconds\, you don't have to sub­mit a pro­
 pos­al\, you don't get any slides\, and the only AV as­sis­tance of­fered 
 is a micro­phone. If you have a BOF to an­noun­ce\, an auc­tion item so ad
 ­vert­ise or any other short mes­sage you can use the trans­i­tion time th
 at would be ot­herw­ise was­ted bet­ween Lig­htn­ing Talks to share your m
 es­sage. Just show up be­fore we start and take a seat in the as­sig­ned s
 eats in the front of the room.\n\nWhy Would You Want to do a Lig­htn­ing T
 alk? Maybe you've never given a talk be­fore\, and you'd like to start sma
 ll. For a Lig­htn­ing Talk\, you don't need to make slides\, and if you do
  de­cide to make slides\, you only need to make three. Maybe you're nerv­o
 us and you're af­raid you'll mess up. It's a lot eas­i­er to plan and de­l
 iv­er a five minute talk than it is to de­liv­er a long talk. And if you d
 o mess up\, at least the pain­ful part will be over quick­ly. Maybe you do
 n't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a ques­tion\, or in­vite 
 peo­ple to help you with your pro­ject\, or boast about some­th­ing you di
 d\, or tell a short cautiona­ry story. These th­ings are all in­terest­ing
  and worth talk­ing about\, but there might not be en­ough to say about th
 em to fill up thir­ty minutes. Maybe you have a lot of th­ings to say\, an
 d you're al­ready going to give a long talk on one of them\, and you don't
  want to hog the spot­light. There's noth­ing wrong with giv­ing sever­al 
 Lig­htn­ing Talks. Hey\, they're only five minutes. On the other side\, pe
 o­ple might want to come to a lig­htn­ing talk when they would­n't come to
  a long talk on the same sub­ject. The risk for the at­tendees is small­er
 : If the talk turns out to be dull\, or if the per­son giv­ing the talk tu
 rns out to be a rea­l­ly bad speak­er\, well\, at least it's over in five 
 minutes. With lig­htn­ing talks\, you're never stuck in some bor­ing lec­t
 ure for forty-five minutes.\n\nStill hav­ing troub­le pick­ing a topic\, h
 ere are some sug­ges­tions:\n\n1. Why my favorite module is X.\n2. I want 
 to do cool pro­ject X. Does an­yone want to help?\n3. Suc­cess­ful Pro­jec
 t: I did pro­ject X. It was a suc­cess. Here's how you could be­nefit.\n4.
  Failed Pro­ject: I did pro­ject X. It was a failure\, and here's why.\n5.
  Heresy: Peo­ple al­ways say X\, but they're wrong. Here's why.\n6. You Al
 l Suck: Here's what is wrong with the our com­mun­ity. 7. Call to Ac­tion:
  Let's all do more of X / less of X.\n8. Would­n't it be cool if X?\n9. So
 me­one needs to do X.\n10. Wish List\n11. Why X was a mis­take.\n12. Why X
  looks like a mis­take\, but isn't.\n13. What it's like to do X.\n14. Here
 's a use­ful tech­nique that wor­ked.\n15. Here's a tech­nique I thought w
 ould be use­ful but didn't work.\n16. Why al­gorithm X sucks.\n17. Com­par
 ison of al­gorithms X and Y.\n\nOf co­ur­se\, you could give the talk on a
 n­yth­ing you wan­ted\, wheth­er or not it is on this list. If we get a fu
 ll schedule of noth­ing but five minutes of rant­ing and rav­ing on each t
 opic\, a good time will still be had by most.

DESCRIPTION:Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is a popular method of impleme
 nting extensions that rely on C libraries in languages such as Ruby\, Pyth
 on and Java.  FFI has not hit the big time in Perl\, but it has some advan
 tages over Perl’s historical extension language XS.  Migrating parts of CP
 AN from XS to FFI may ease the transition to alternative Perl implementati
 ons or Perl 6.  In this talk I will compare and contrast the two technique
 s in the context of Perl today\, using as an example the work that I did i
 mplementing FFI bindings for libarchive with FFI::Raw (Archive::Libarchive
 ::FFI).  I will focus on work I did creating and using infrastructure that
  should be applicable to many FFI projects.

DESCRIPTION:One criticism of opponents of Perl is that it is a "write-only"
  language meaning that once the code is written\, it is extremely difficul
 t to maintain because it is difficult to understand upon re-examination. A
 s with many criticisms\, this should be aimed at those undisciplined devel
 opers who are writing the code\, and not their tool of choice.\n\nHaving s
 aid that\, I think it is also fair to say that Perl makes it very easy to 
 write difficult-to-decipher code. This is the double­edged sword which is 
 the shorthand Perl gives us to be very expressive in a small amount of spa
 ce. A negative application of this is obfuscated Perl (where the author in
 tentionally makes his code difficult to read)\, while a more positive appl
 ication is the craft of creating Perl "one­liners" (trying to include a gr
 eat deal of functionality in a single line of code). A one­liner can be a 
 powerful weapon in the arsenal of a system administrator.\n\nIn this talk:
 \n* We'll look at a line of code in a subroutine that is in desperate need
  of readability changes\n* We'll make the code more readable by introducin
 g:\n    * appropriate whitespace\n    * different ways of writing the same
  thing\, for example: $array[$#array] vs. $array[-1]\n    * useful names f
 or variables\, versus $index\, $j $k $l\, etc\n    * breaking up one line 
 of code into multiple lines\n    * exploring further improvements through 
 Perl::Critic and by extension Perl::Tidy\n\nThis talk will be beginner-fri
 endly.

DESCRIPTION:The act of computer programming often involves the use of creat
 ivity to do things such as\; solve problems\, design APIs and architect so
 lutions. Can we then infer that the use of creativity during the act means
  that the produced result is a piece of art? Of course not\, but does that
  mean that code itself cannot be viewed in an aesthetic light? Can code be
  art? For that matter\, what is art? \n\nThis talk will attempt to answer 
 some of those questions and more. In it we will take a look at some of the
  ideas and techniques of the 37\,000 year old discipline of art making and
  attempt to apply them to the 60 year old discipline of computer programmi
 ng.
